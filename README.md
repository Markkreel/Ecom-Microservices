# E-commerce Microservices Platform

A modern, scalable e-commerce platform built using microservices architecture. This project demonstrates best practices in distributed systems design, containerization, and cloud-native development.

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of the following microservices:

- **User Service** (Java/Spring Boot): Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management
- **Product Service** (Java/Spring Boot): Manages product catalog and inventory
- **Order Service** (Python/FastAPI): Processes customer orders and manages order lifecycle
- **Notification Service** (Node.js): Handles system notifications and communications

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Services**: Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **API Gateway**: API Gateway for routing and load balancing
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production deployment)
- Java 11 or higher
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecom-microservices.git
cd ecom-microservices
```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the services:

- API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
- User Service: http://localhost:8081
- Product Service: http://localhost:8082
- Order Service: http://localhost:8083
- Notification Service: http://localhost:8084

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**

   - Follow language-specific style guides
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
2. **Git Workflow**

   - Create feature branches from `develop`
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Submit PRs for code review
3. **API Design**

   - Follow RESTful principles
   - Use consistent error handling
   - Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger

## Deployment

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. Apply Kubernetes configurations:

```bash
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/
```

2. Verify deployments:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Infrastructure as Code

Terraform configurations are available in `infrastructure/terraform/` for cloud deployment.
